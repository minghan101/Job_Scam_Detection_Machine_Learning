Junior System Test Analyst,"GB, CMD, London",Technology,19000-19000,"<p>The Technical Team and offering at VML London has a very strong heritage dating back to the mid-nineties when the London office was founded. Back in those days we were one of the first few purely digital marketing agencies in London; and back then things were a lot more technically driven than they often are today; as such the Technology team here continues to enjoy a strong strategic influence on the work that the agency undertakes and the clients that we engage.</p>
<p>It just works.</p>
<p>Technology is brilliant when you don’t have to think about it. That’s what we strive for in our solutions. Our technology team has a strong strategic influence on the work we undertake and are involved as soon as the brief lands. They stay involved throughout strategy, creative concepting and design. Acting as important enablers, we bring new and emerging technology to the table to successfully marry the requirements of our clients with the vision of our creatives.</p>
<p>Open standards, open minds.</p>
<p>We aim to deliver the most elegant technical solution for your budget, and maintain a technology agnostic approach to development in order to achieve that. Technology can be expensive, both in terms of hard costs and costly mistakes, so we’re as careful with your money as we are with our own.   Perhaps that’s why some of our clients have been with us for over 10 years.<br> <br>When faced with a new problem our first instinct is always to see if someone else has already solved it. As such, the solutions we design are built on the rich eco-system of open source software (OSS); the proven and battle-tested kind that we know will not just do the job quickly and cost-effectively, but also robustly. Where OSS isn't appropriate we always favour solutions that are built to open standards that we know will integrate well with other technologies.</p>
<p>Strong partnerships.</p>
<p>Our work is complemented by strong partnerships with technology vendors and suppliers.   Proven over time, our established strategic relationships with many of the leaders in software, hardware and other technology solutions help ensure we’re able to continue to offer best-in-class technical solutions for our clients.</p>

Using both manual inspection and automated methods, our software has been tested thousands of times before going live. The increasingly complex high availability – high performance web applications, mobile sites and applications and digital experiences we build require quality software engineering and the VML system testing team is our backstop to make sure our development is as good as can be.</p>
<p>As such VML are looking for a Junior System Test Analyst to join our team and help improve the quality level even further. We are looking for someone who is passionate about testing and quality.

<p>The company deals primarily with R&amp;D Tax Credits and Grants, but is also in the process of launching some exciting new finance products for the tech space.</p>
<p>We’ve had a very profitable first three years as a company, with turnover growing threefold each year, and we managed to bring in more than £1m in our third year.</p>
<p>We believe in working healthy and productive hours. The best work is done by people who are happy and well rested - and we want the best work.</p>
<p>Following the example of companies who’ve managed to successfully implement a modern culture, such as <a href=""#URL_a1bfaad40769f5d02277f243919009261f7bcfc01f769800a4c9e7fd0414ba4f#"" rel=""nofollow"" class=""external"">Semco</a>, <a href=""#URL_cdc1234d020e7e42cb592b0329ad3f9e50d0eb4b8eed36aa020b7469e247f424#"" rel=""nofollow"" class=""external"">Valve</a>, and <a href=""#URL_f7abd94283c87c1ad9eefc55150e73aabbf65effd013b40898b27470c6e9cb94#"" rel=""nofollow"" class=""external"">Zappos</a>, we are building a progressive, open-minded, non-traditional organisation. Unless you have worked in a forward thinking startup (particularly in the Valley), it’s likely that you have never seen a similar working environment. Benefits of working with us include flexible and remote working, an empowering and vibrant place to work and a pool table, amongst others.</p>","<p>Do you love helping people in the startup scene? Can you quickly understand the funding problems faced by business owners and think on your feet to come up with effective case-specific solutions? Can you make sense of the continually-evolving sea of government funding options? And would you have a genuine interest in researching this further? Could you identify relevant opportunities to add to the current GrantTree offering so we can get more startups to the next level? Do you want to be part of a team which is striving to grow and become the go-to place for startups who want equity-free funding? If so, read on, this might be the role for you!</p>
<p>The purpose of the role is simple and elegant - to make sure everyone who contacts GrantTree has a great experience, and much like the swan adage, a lot needs to be going on underneath to make this happen. We need someone who can understand and address the needs of everyone who reaches out to GrantTree, over the phone, via email or in person - communication skills are paramount! The role requires a friendly, energetic, tech enthusiast who understands our values and can make sure they are shining in every interaction with our potential clients. Internally, the Grant Funding Advisor will work closely with our key players in Promotions, New Products and Partnerships to make sure everything we learn from those who connect with us can be built into our solution space!</p>
<p>GrantTree is a different place to work. We believe in openness and transparency. Our financials are open to all employees - salaries, expenses, etc, all visible. We believe in trust and responsibility rather than command and control. To succeed in this environment, you must be genuinely self-motivated and highly effective in self-management, whilst also being team-minded, helpful and generous with your time. More of that on our website - please have a read about our culture and values before you apply!</p>","<p>Here are some of the things we are looking for in a perfect candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exceptional communicator - written, over the phone, and in person, both client side and internally. You would be the first point of contact to anyone who reaches out to us!</li>
<li>Highly organised - making sure that the effort you put in can be kept track of and made use of in the future.</li>
<li>Awesome research skills - drive to understand the government funding space inside out, and the ability to convert complex briefs in to easily digestible sets of requirements.</li>
<li>Enthusiasm for all things startup - desire to get out there to events, make connections and really understand where we fit in with other businesses and where we can add value.</li>
</ul>","<p>Pay for this role is £28k/y. In addition to this, we offer a revenue-share model for employees within the company, with a company-wide quarterly bonus scheme. </p>

Technical Product Development Manager (Web),"GR, I, Athens",,,"Hellas Direct is a new insurance company founded in 2011 with the view of changing the way car insurance companies service their clients. We embrace transparency in everything we do and we believe that the Greek consumer deserves a better customer experience.

The phrase 'Rethink Insurance' captures the essence of why we exist as a company. Our mission is to change the Greek insurance market, one policy at a time. To do so, we must challenge all assumptions and revisit the way things are currently being done. We are starting with a blank piece of paper and - with the help and support of our strategic partners - we want to redefine what customer service really means. We invite you to join us in our journey and to get to know us along the way.

Hellas Direct is the trade name of HD Insurance Ltd, a Cyprus non-life insurance company. HD Insurance Ltd is regulated by the Cyprus Superintendent of Insurance and authorised by the Bank of Greece to carry out insurance business in the Hellenic Republic.","<h3>Role Context</h3>
<p>Hellas Direct (HD) is a well-funded insurance start-up that is replicating the direct-to-consumer motor insurance model in Greece.</p>
<p>Having analysed and evaluated 65+ off-the-shelf software systems, HD has decided that the best systems procurement strategy is to develop its own systems in-house.</p>
<p>HD already has an excellent in-house development team and the systems needed to support HD’s innovative product offering and customer service have already been up and running (with all the basics that were needed to launch a direct-to-consumer on-line motor insurance sales website) since the 6th August 2012 with 99.97% availability.</p>

</ul><p>External and internal communications</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreeing suitable mechanisms and documentation with the rest of the business to communicate the contents of forthcoming releases to third parties and internally;</li>

<li>Managing the process by which requirements are prioritised and packaged into releases and presenting recommendations to the management team for decision (if necessary).</li>

<p><b>Why do we do it?</b></p>
<p>Financial sector is not focused on serving the interests of small businesses. Big banking monopolies and behind-the-door deals have made finance exclusive for limited amount of people. This, however, is inefficient for business.</p>
<p>On one side, there are plentiful investors with idle cash on their balance, because traditional finance has failed them. On the other side, there is a myriad of companies who cannot get a business loan form a bank, because they lack sufficient collateral. Neither can they involve angel investor nor venture capitalists due to exclusivity and high fees.</p>
<p>However, collateral does not build businesses - people with great ideas do! Here is where Investly steps in and joins the hands of forward-looking investors and vigorous companies, who seek to create value with their businesses. We help these entrepreneurs to step over the Death Valley by providing the platform on which trustworthy companies can raise funds form a community of investors who feel connected with their investments.</p>

Graduate Creative Developer,"GB, CMD, London",Technology,19000-19000,"<p>The Technical Team and offering at VML London has a very strong heritage dating back to the mid-nineties when the London office was founded. Back in those days we were one of the first few purely digital marketing agencies in London; and back then things were a lot more technically driven than they often are today; as such the Technology team here continues to enjoy a strong strategic influence on the work that the agency undertakes and the clients that we engage.</p>
<p>It just works.</p>
<p>Technology is brilliant when you don’t have to think about it. That’s what we strive for in our solutions. Our technology team has a strong strategic influence on the work we undertake and are involved as soon as the brief lands. They stay involved throughout strategy, creative concepting and design. Acting as important enablers, we bring new and emerging technology to the table to successfully marry the requirements of our clients with the vision of our creatives.</p>
<p>Open standards, open minds.</p>
<p>We aim to deliver the most elegant technical solution for your budget, and maintain a technology agnostic approach to development in order to achieve that. Technology can be expensive, both in terms of hard costs and costly mistakes, so we’re as careful with your money as we are with our own.   Perhaps that’s why some of our clients have been with us for over 10 years.<br> <br>When faced with a new problem our first instinct is always to see if someone else has already solved it. As such, the solutions we design are built on the rich eco-system of open source software (OSS); the proven and battle-tested kind that we know will not just do the job quickly and cost-effectively, but also robustly. Where OSS isn't appropriate we always favour solutions that are built to open standards that we know will integrate well with other technologies.</p>
<p>Strong partnerships.</p>
<p>Our work is complemented by strong partnerships with technology vendors and suppliers.   Proven over time, our established strategic relationships with many of the leaders in software, hardware and other technology solutions help ensure we’re able to continue to offer best-in-class technical solutions for our clients.</p>
